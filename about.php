                <p class="about">I am an upcoming web and systems developer. 
                    I started learning programming in mid 2020, 
                    I took on the hobby of creating small and simple web pages. 
                    At the age of 12 I got into the more advanced level of programming 
                    and started learning python. I got interested into Web Development. 
                    By late 2021 I started learning PHP, JavaScript, Java and C. 
                    Today on creating my first ever website. 
                    I hope to improve my web development skills 
                    and in the near future I would like to get my hands onto Systems Development</p>
